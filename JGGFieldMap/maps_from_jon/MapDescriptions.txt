These fieldmaps contain the magnetic fields for JGG and Rosie.

JGGfield.dat:
The Ziptrack measurement of the JGG field. This was done before any
coils broke.

JGGfieldZipN.dat:
These are the JGG ziptrack map scaled by the ratio of the maps from
JGGfieldN to JGGfieldA from Bob Wands' models.
(JGGfieldZipA.dat would be identical to JGGfield.dat.)
If these rescaled maps turn out to be useful, they will have to be updated
every time JGGfield.dat is updated.

JGGfieldA.dat to JGGfieldD.dat:
These maps are from models that Bob Wands ran.
Period A : Winter 2002-2003, Ziptracking was done
           No MIPP data runs
Period B : After 27 May'04 coil shorts, including first MIPP physics data
           MIPP runs 0 to 13424
Period C : After 21 Mar'05 coil shorts, including most MIPP physics data
           MIPP runs 13425 to 17264
Period D : After 13 Jan'06 to 10 Feb'06, MIPP physics data was taken
           MIPP runs 17265 to 17677
These maps have been moved to the CVS attic on 19-mar-2007 because they
are not useful for MIPP data reconstruction/analysis.

Rosiefield.dat:
The latest greatest Rosie fieldmap from Ziptrack with Raja's rotation
in one corner.

JGGfieldext9.dat and JGGfieldext18.dat:
These are maps for proposed new coils to replace the failed JGG coils.
For better field uniformity the coils in these models are extended
by 9 inches and 18 inches along the beam direction. This produces more
uniform fields in the TPC region. DO NOT USE THESE MAPS TO ANALYSE DATA
TAKEN IN MIPP RUN BEFORE MARCH 2006!

Currents in JGG were changing with coils failing. JGG currents were as
follows:
Period   Total Current   Current Top   Current Bottom
  A        1373 A            687 A         687 A
  B        1435 A            643 A         791 A
  C        1579 A            643 A         936 A
  D        1625 A            644 A         981 A
Total Current: Numbers are readback (actual) current from Acnet. Set
currents were 1400 A, 1450 A, 1600 A, and 1645 A for periods A to D
respectively.
